# My AirDrop - seamless data transfer between devices

## Why is it, that in 2025, we are still sending things between computers via email?

I wanted to solve this issue, and I looked no further than the most convenient, lucrative, and effective file transfer service ever - **AirDrop**. This service effectively created and maintained Apple's dominant ecosystem, and is extremely helpful and versatile. Although I couldn't implement this to include mobile as well *even though if I could, I'd probably be a millionaire*, it is aimed at seamless network transfer to hosts on the same LAN. 

I took a Computer Networking class at Stony Brook last semester, and thought I should practice some C programming to build this functionality. I needed to create a simple protocol, broadcasting, and daemon to enable this feature. It is currently a work in progress, but once I finish up, I'll document the entire development process!

# Repo for fun laidback projects and LeetCode solutions

I created a repo for all my coding adventures. Right now, I have:
1. `c_funsies` for projects in C (and C++ soon, *hopefully*)
2. `interview_prep` for specific interview preparation
3. `leetcode` for leetcode solutions
4. `react` for small React projects

Check them out, I try to document as much as possible :)
